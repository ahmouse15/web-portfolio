## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Design
2-page design:\
**Blog** containing tutorials for difficult issues, or dev explanations on how I tackled different problems.\
**Showcase** will show off some of my skills, including projects I've worked on, what I learned from them, and the tools I used

It will be hosted on ahmouse.com
